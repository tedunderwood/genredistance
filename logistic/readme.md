predictive modeling
===================

Scripts used for predictive modeling.

The place to start here is **genre_experiment.py**, and more specifically I would start at the end of the file, where you can see which functions were actually invoked as part of the experiment.

Comparing models against other models became an o^2 situation in the number of models, so that part of the work was done on a cluster. That's why I had to "create assignment files"--so I could distribute different parts of the grid to different cluster nodes.
