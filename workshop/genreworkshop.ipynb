    "\n",
    "We know that certain measures of textual similarity do behave like distances: for instance, if we measure Euclidean distances in vector space, they are 100% guaranteed to behave like a distance metric. Cosine distances are more ambiguous: they don't obey the triangle inequality. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we train classifiers to recognize genres, we will have a measure of similarity closely tied to the identity of specific genres that is not *at all* guaranteed to behave like distance: as we will see in a moment, classifier accuracy may not even obey the rule of symmetry: it can be farther from A to B than it is from B to A.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to test these different measures of textual similarity, and see which ones correspond most closely to other intuitions about the proximity of genres. So we need a measure of proximity that isn't based in textual comparison. The measure we choose probably won't be infallible, but it should at least be independent of textual similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. A social measure of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we could use library metadata. If two genre/form/subject headings are often assigned to the same books, we might infer that they're related.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the experiment I'm retracing here,](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4507) I used both \"subject\" headings (which began to be assigned relatively early in the history of the Library of Congress system), and \"genre\" headings, which only got added toward the end of the 20th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "I measured the overlap between headings using the [pointwise mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information) of their co-association with volumes:\n",
    " \n",
    "    log(p(x, y) / p(x)p(y)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where p(x) is, for instance, the probability that a volume is labeled \"Humor,\" p(y) the probability that a volume is labeled \"Horror,\" and p(x, y) the probability that the same volume is labeled \"Humor\" and \"Horror.\" The number will be higher if two headings frequently occur together\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of messy details involved in the actual calculation, and running it takes more than half an hour, because I'm using a large collection of volumes from HathiTrust. So I won't try to recreate it all in this workshop; we'll just load a pre-computed similarity matrix.

We'll reduce each genre to a vector of 10,000 word frequencies, and adjust the word frequencies for inverse document frequency using [a strategy commonly applied in information retrieval.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Spärck_Jones) The term of art for vectors adjusted this way is term frequency - inverse document frequency: tf-idf.\n",

    "Let's try another way to measure the similarity between genres, using predictive models. This will have the advantage of ensuring that our measure of similarity is tightly tailored to the features that matter for a particular genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, here's how we might measure the similarity of short stories and juvenile fiction: Model A learns to distinguish short stories from a random sample of fiction, distributed across the timeline in the same way the short stories are distributed. Model B learns to distinguish juvenile fiction from another random sample (with a different chronological distribution, matching the distribution of juvenile fiction). We use regularized logistic regression as a learning algorithm. The number of features and regularization constant are tuned by grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we apply each model to the works used in the other, and compare the way they rank the books by probability of belonging to a or b.
