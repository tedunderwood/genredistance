Genre workshop
==============

Materials for a hands-on workshop at UNC on Feb 6, 2019. We will explore basic questions about the nature of "distance" and "similarity" in a cultural space, as well as a few handy tricks like multidimensional scaling and pointwise mutual information.

The workshop will center on a Python 3 Jupyter notebook in **genreworkshop.ipynb**. Everything else here is supporting data or illustrations for the notebook.
