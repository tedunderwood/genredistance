    "\n",
    "There are three categories of genres in this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary genres; our main samples of \"subject\" and \"genre\" categories from HathiTrust. Each 100 volumes in length, with a few minor fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"B Genres,\" secondary (non-overlapping) samples of the primary categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Intersection genres,\" which should really be called \"symmetric difference\" genres, because they are the opposite of an intersection. When we compare e.g. \"Psychological fiction\" to \"Love stories,\" we encounter the complication that some books are both. This is an important fact about genre, but also the source of our evidence about social proximity, and when comparing textual distance to social proximity we want to avoid circularity. So we need the option to compare samples that are non-overlapping, not only in the sense that they don't contain the same books, but in the sense that our sample of psychological fiction contains no love stories, and vice versa. To do this, we exclude psychological fic from the love story model, and make up the deficit with a special \"intersection genre\" labeled Love-Not-Psychological--an implausible assertion in itself, but indicating here a small group of books randomly samples from \"love stories minus the ones tagged as psychological."
