These Jupyter notebooks do much of the heavy lifting for the experiment, calculating correlations between textual and social similarity and using MDS to generate "maps" of genre.

They address the results of predictive modeling, word vectors (tfidf), and topic vectors, respectively.

To run **compare_tfidf_vectors**, you'll need a file **rawcounts.tsv**, which is too big for the repo. You can generate it from the data (see the top-level directory for this repo). Or, as a shortcut, here's a Dropbox link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mm5zmgcw6445qy/rawcounts.tsv?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mm5zmgcw6445qy/rawcounts.tsv?dl=0) It's 1.5GB.
