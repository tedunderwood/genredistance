Measures of distance between genres
===================================

Exploring textual and social measures of the distance between genres of fiction.

Work in this repository may be presented at the ACL in 2018, and in Montreal at the conference "Novel Worlds."

Technical note: while the measures explored here may be ["statistical distances,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance) they are usually not "metrics."
