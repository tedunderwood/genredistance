Measures of distance between genres
===================================

Exploring textual and social measures of the distance between genres of fiction. Work in this repository supports Ted Underwood, "The Historical Significance of Textual Distances," presented at LaTeCH-CLfL workshop associated with COLING in Santa Fe, 2018.

Measuring similarity is a basic task in information retrieval, and now often a building-block for more complex arguments about cultural change. But do measures of textual similarity and distance really correspond to evidence about cultural proximity and differentiation? To explore that question empirically, this paper compares textual and social measures of the similarities between genres of English-language fiction. Existing measures of textual similarity (cosine similarity on tf-idf vectors or topic vectors) are also compared to new strategies that strive to anchor textual measurement in a social context.

Technical note: while the measures explored here may be ["statistical distances,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance) they are usually not "metrics."
